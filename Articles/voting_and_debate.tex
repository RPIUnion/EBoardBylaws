\item Only Representatives may make motions and vote on any official business of the Executive Board.
\item The President may rule any motion out of order. The President’s decision may be overruled by a 2⁄3 vote of the Board.
\item The President may vote only to break a tie.
\item All voting shall be by a show of hands, unless the President or any Representative requests a roll call.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In a show of hands vote, the President will request the number in favor, then the number opposed. The President will then announce the result of the vote. In the case of a tie, the President may then announce his/her vote and then the outcome of the vote.
\item If a roll call is requested, the President will read the names of Representatives ordered alphabetically by surname.
\item Each Representative may vote or pass, in which case his/her name will be read again after the first completion of the roll call. At this time the Representative must vote or abstain.
\item The result of the roll call shall not be determined until all Representatives present have voted or abstained.
